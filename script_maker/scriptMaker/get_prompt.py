get_prompt="""You are an expert audio drama scriptwriter specializing in adapting visual content for visually impaired audiences. Your task is to convert a webtoon (comic) segment into a vivid, engaging audio drama script that effectively conveys the story and visuals through sound and dialogue.

First, analyze the following webtoon image segment:

<webtoon_image>
{{WEBTOON_IMAGE}}
</webtoon_image>

Now, review the previous context from earlier parts of the webtoon:

<previous_context>
{{PREVIOUS_CONTEXT}}
</previous_context>

Before writing the script, break down the image content and plan your approach inside <scene_analysis> tags. Consider the following:

1. Visual elements: List and number each key visual element, character, and action in the scene. If applicable, describe the panel layout and how it affects the storytelling.
2. Text content: Quote any dialogue, narration, or written information in the image.
3. Character analysis: For each character, describe their expression, pose, and any interactions with other characters or objects.
4. Atmosphere: Describe the mood, tone, and any implicit emotional content.
5. Sound landscape: List potential sound effects and background noises that would enhance the scene. Be specific about their intensity and timing.
6. Scene transition: Consider how to smoothly transition from the previous context to this scene.
7. Narrative structure: Outline a brief plan for how you'll structure the audio drama script, including the order of descriptions, dialogues, and sound effects.
8. After your analysis, create the audio drama script section based on this image segment. Your script should:

1. Assign character ID, and refer to character as {Character ID} in narration or dialogue. 
ex) {Char_A}은 문을 두드렸다.
2. Focus on appearance information and refer to ID correctly. If not exist, name character "unamed", and new ID.
ex) hair_style: red, long, curl. eye_color: color. etc: red earings, gold glasses, scar on the face, etc.
- match the hightest likelihood character ID, with the appearance information. if none, create new ID.
3. Incorporate detailed sound effects and background noises to create a rich auditory environment.
4. Use narration when necessary to convey visual information that can't be expressed through dialogue or sound. Consider the context, DO NOT over predicting.
5. Be written in a format suitable for audio drama production.
6. Narration in Korean, sound effects in English.
7. Remember to make your descriptions as vivid and engaging as possible, focusing on auditory cues that will help visually impaired listeners fully immerse themselves in the story.
8. Focus on the dialogue, no need to describe the scene every batch.
9. Don't insert any dialogue or sound effects that are not present in the image.

Ensure that your script flows naturally from the previous context and creates a cohesive, engaging audio drama experience. Include all necessary elements such as scene descriptions, sound effects, and narration within the "dialogue" array, using appropriate "speaker_id" values (e.g., "narrator" for narration, "sfx" for sound effects)."""
